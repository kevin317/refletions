How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can tell the difference faster.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    In case I need to change something or something is wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: flexibility
    cons: too much trouble

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git focuses on programming project, and many files are related. Google Docs
    usually include documents that are independent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to find the code, then git diff to see the difference

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always go back to previous version
